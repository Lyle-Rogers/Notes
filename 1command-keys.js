// When in a html or edge file, writing div or nav will give the option to create a complete div or
// nav for you. Also works with all other common syntaxs. If you put a, it'll make an a tag with a
// href ready to be sorced. And if you put div.dog, it'll create a div tag with a class name of dog.
// There are many ways of using this type of syntax to make writing code quick and easy.
// Another example is: .navbar-item.has-dropdown.is-hoverable The dot before navbar is a simple way
// of saying div. And the dots in between the the class name is seperating the name with a space. So
// that we can write class names with more than one single name. That sentense essentially turns
// into this: <div class="navbar-item has-dropdown is-hoverable"></div>
