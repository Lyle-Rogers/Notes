you have to adabt to change. Coding will always grow and new great things are yet to be discovered.

How to learn a new language.
Watch a full tutorial series on the language, when I’m watching I don’t try to follow along, I simply watch what the instructor does in the demos so I can get a high level view of the language syntax and flow.
Create a hello world application, I’ll incorporate a few basics, such as running a loop, creating and instantiating a class, and any other high level concepts I remember from the tutorial.
Pick out a sorting algorithm and implement it in the language. It’s fine if the sorting algorithm is a basic one like selection or bubble sort. Sorting algorithms force you to use: data structures, loops, variables, and functions. Combining each of these elements will give you a good handle on how the language works.
Go through an advanced tutorial on the language and this time follow along and build the programs with the instructor.
Go through coding interview questions for the language. Being able to confidently answer these questions will give you a good idea if you have a solid understanding of the language.

Take it one step at a time.
Get a big project and break it down one block at a time. Making it into tiny features you can work on every day and
it'll get done faster and easier without being scared about how big it is.

Writing bad code is imorral.

When solving small problems, take a bigger look at the project and make sure that the little thing you are solving
is'nt going to ruin something else on the project and make life complicated and hard.

Use the knowledge already out there by people who are very experienced. To ignore all that valuable knowledge is 
unresponceble.
