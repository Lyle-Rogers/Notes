// Install node.js and npm. Then install android studio to simulate android divices. Then install the
// expo cli with: npm install --global expo-cli. Create the react native expo app with: expo init
// name-of-application. You can start the react native app with: npm start. After this you'll see the
// the react native developer tools in the browser. Install the android studio divice emulater at the
// android studios avd manager after creating a new project with android studio. Select the newst 
// options for the divice emulater. Start the divice emulater and if you run a in the terminal thats
// running the react native app or click the botton Run on Android device/emulator in the developer
// tools it'll run the react native project with the divice emulator. Then if you have and android, 
// there's this app named expo go that will run the development project with the android device in
// delopment so the project will refresh on your phone every time you update the code. To set up the
// react native project with your phone use the expo go bar code scanner and scan the bar code in the
// deloper tools kit. The project should be running perfect with the emulator and on the device. Windows
// is not allowed to use iPhone emulators and is only alowed to in the browser with expos snack website.
// We need to put the app in git then run the git project repository with snack. Go to the snack website
// here https://snack.expo.dev/ then find were it is you put you git repo and run it with the ios emulater
// or with androids emulater or the webs emulater as well.





// expo init expo-app-name -t tabs: Makes an expo react native application with with tabs or navigation already setup. 
// tabs sets up the app with preconfigured components, constants, screens, navigation and hooks directories which will 
// save to much time sense you would normally make those directories yourself and have to remember everything there as 
// well. Then -t is so that the react native creates the apps files in typescript instead of javascript like it would 
// do normally.
