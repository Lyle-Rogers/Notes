# This view set makes things easier and simpler I think but endless you like using less urls there is really no reason to use this type of view set I'm pretty sure.


# The view set here is awesome because it mixes the mixins with the viewsets view set. This is so that it needs only 1 url just like the other view sets we descussed above that need only 1 url and they can use the exact same url. Then you can pass the queryset this view set is for and that querysets serializer with the exact mixins you'll use to edit the queryset, leave a mixin out of the view set to not use the functionality of that mixin, and everything just works great.

# This view set is perfect for use and recommended whenever it's possible because it can't be used if there's extra functionality that's not supported by it. It's the same as the other mixins view set on top and only has 1 url just like that 1 above. The only difference with it is there wasn't any mixins added to it because the mixins are setup with this view set automatically. If there's functionality in this view set you wish wasn't there than use the view set above and don't add the mixin with the functionality that u didn't want.
