This is how to use aws with the react frontend:
First check if the git staging branch is up to date with the git pull origin staging command.
Checkout into the Prod git branch. Then merge the Prod git branch with the staging git branch with git pull origin staging.
Then push everything to the git Prod branch with git push.
Next after everything is live we will npm run build. This will create the disc folder that will be given to the aws bucket to host the react
front end with the internet.
