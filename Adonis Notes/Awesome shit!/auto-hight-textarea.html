<!-- This makes a textarea that auto hights itself. So every time the user gets
to the bottom of the text erea when typing, the textarea gives itself an extra 5 
pixels so that the user can see the whole text as the text gets bigger. -->


<!-- This little thingy here is blowing my mind. This is inside a textarea where
the class would go: onkeyup="autoheight(this)". What this is doing is exacuting the 
autoheight function every time a key is clicked on the keyboard if the textarea is
in view. The argument passed to the auto hight function was this. Wtf dose this mean, 
am I right. Well apearently this is a javascript reserved word if used correctly. 
In this case, this means the textarea itself. So we just passed a textarea to a function!  -->
