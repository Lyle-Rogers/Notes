Adonis comes with a list of commands you can run that will auto build models, controllers, and much more. It helps make
life simplair by doing a lot of the dirty work for you. (e.g. adonis make:model Todo -m -c This makes a model named Todo
and creates a migration and controller for the todo model with some code already ritten in all three folders)
