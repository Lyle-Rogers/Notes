Since we are rendering the view here we can go to routes.js in start and change its http call for index to get instead of on and erase the render method since this view is now being rendered through the controller. Then add the job controller to the get call so the view and controller are linked through http. Finally the {object} after index in the render method is converting all the data in the jobs variable to json so that the render method can render it with the view and the view can acces the data in jobs.
