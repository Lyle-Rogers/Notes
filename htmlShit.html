<!-- First of all, this thing here is beyond awesome. The type radio is adding a circle to the end of the input that is checkable like a check box. So you can make a form with a list of options and when a user clicks an oprtion the outer circle turns blue, Yay! I'm certain it works the same way the checkbox bellow works. -->
<input type="radio" name="animal" id="cats" value="cats"><br><br>


<!-- This is simular to radio except instead its a box with a checkmark. -->
<div class="field">
  <label class="checkbox">
      <input type="checkbox" name="remember">
      Remember me
  </label>
</div>
